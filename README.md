# Pockets
A Google Chrome extension that allows you to easily manage your tabs bar by grouping tabs together into a pocket. You can then flash or dull the pockets depending on if you are using the tabs.

You could create a "work" pocket consisting of the tabs you have open while doing research at work. When you're done for the day, dull the "work" pocket and watch all of those tabs that you used for research dissapear and unclutter your tab bar. The URLs are safely stored in a pocket.

Now you're ready for social media so you flash your "social" pocket that you had already created before. Instantly Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook are loaded and ready to go. 

You won't ever have to think about manually opening the same tabs for work or relaxation everyday! Try Pockets now!
